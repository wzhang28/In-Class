# Team Work Guidelines

We have set up Teams for each group. You may have gotten an email about being assigned to a group. These groups are private to you and your team mates. 

For the Northwind exercise you can place your work in the supplied repository (for A01-Team-A, your repo is called Northwind-A01-Team-A).

### Steps:

1. have ONE person on your team clone the Northwind repo to their computer
2. that person will open Repository Settings (under the gear)
3. go to Line endings and attributes
4. if there is NO .gitattributes file create one for Visual Studio, OK, do a commit
5. if you have a Northwind exercise solution folder already created, drag it into this repo
6. if you have NOT yet created the solution folder and the projects, then create the solution and projects in this folder
7. check your website bin folder and remove your NorthwindSystem.ddl and NorthwindSystem.Data.ddl (if they exist)
8. do a commit
9. go to your git shell and force the bin files and issue the commit
10. sync your commits
11. notify your fellow teammates that they can clone the Northwind repo to their computer

You now will be sharing one solution to the exercise between team members

### Suggested work session rules to follow:

1. When startng a work session Always Sync First.
2. NEVER leave live code that does not compile in your solution when you sync. COMMENT those lines of code out. Your code SHOULD NEVER cause someone else to get a compile error.
3. Commit frequently during your work session
4. you MAY sync frequently during your work session
5. Close your VS before your final sync of the work session. Check, if there is an outstanding commit that is needed. If so, do it.
6. Do one final sync BEFORE ending your work session. This will ensure all of your work is up on github.

Hopefully, this will help you gettng started on a group project.
